# Final-Project-DTS_IOT-FGA
This project is a final project in the DTS-IOT program. We named this project "Flood Detection using ESP32 and Lora". 
The workings of this system are monitoring water levels using ultrasonic(HC-SR04) sensors, but we use the Lora module for communication media and forward it to the AWS MQTT client using the gateway we created.
